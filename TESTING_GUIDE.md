## üîß Creating Your Own Test Documents

### Method 1: Text to PDF Conversion
```bash
cd rag_app
python create_test_pdfs.py
```

### Method 2: Manual PDF Creation
1. Create text files with your content
2. Use online converters or tools like:
   - **Pandoc**: `pandoc input.txt -o output.pdf`
   - **LibreOffice**: Open text file and export as PDF
   - **Google Docs**: Upload text and download as PDF

### Method 3: Web Scraping
```python
# Example: Convert web pages to PDF
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas

def web_to_pdf(url, output_file):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    text = soup.get_text()
    # Convert to PDF using reportlab
```

## üìä Testing Scenarios
