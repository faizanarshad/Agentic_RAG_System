# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. RAG systems first retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then use that information to generate responses.

## How RAG Works

### 1. Document Processing
- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from various document formats (PDF, Word, HTML)
- **Chunking**: Split documents into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Embedding Generation**: Convert text chunks into vector embeddings
- **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in a vector database

### 2. Query Processing
- **Query Understanding**: Analyze the user's question
- **Embedding Generation**: Convert query to vector embedding
- **Similarity Search**: Find most relevant document chunks
- **Context Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant information

### 3. Response Generation
- **Context Integration**: Combine retrieved information with the query
- **LLM Processing**: Use language model to generate response
- **Response Refinement**: Ensure response is accurate and relevant

## Components of RAG Systems

### Vector Database
- **Purpose**: Store and search document embeddings
- **Popular Options**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS
- **Features**: Fast similarity search, scalability, persistence

### Embedding Models
- **Purpose**: Convert text to numerical vectors
- **Popular Models**: OpenAI embeddings, Sentence-BERT, Cohere
- **Considerations**: Model size, accuracy, speed, cost

### Language Models
- **Purpose**: Generate responses based on retrieved context
- **Popular Models**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Llama
- **Considerations**: Model capability, cost, response time

### Retrieval System
- **Purpose**: Find most relevant information

- **Optimization**: Query expansion, re-ranking, filtering

## Types of RAG Systems

### 1. Naive RAG

### 3. Self-RAG
- Self-reflection on retrieved information
- Quality assessment of responses
- Iterative improvement

### 4. Agentic RAG
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Tool usage and function calling
- Complex reasoning chains
- Dynamic workflow adaptation

## Benefits of RAG Systems
